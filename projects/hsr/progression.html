            <h2>Key Tips and Strategies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class="list-border">
                    <b>General</b>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Focus on the Main Story first and only start roaming around when you're forced to level up to unlock the next Main Story mission</li>
                        <li>Level up your characters to current level cap. The stats you gain make a huge difference, but also the damage formula itself is affected by the difference in levels between you and the enemy. So if you attack an enemy with a higher level than you, you will simply do less damage to them.</li>
                        <li>Equip Light Cones with matching Path to the character or else you won't get its passive bonus (only the basic stats bonus).</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li class="list-border">
                    <b>Combat</b>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Build a team with skill point spenders and generators. Spenders are your damage dealers and generators are usually supports who don't need to use their Skill every turn. If you will build a team with 4 damage dealers, they will compete for the Skill Points and their damage output will be terrible.</li>
                        <li>Become a turtle. Running a more defensive team is not only safer, but actually works better in the early game. Some of the bosses have nasty mechanics and without a healer/shielder combo in your team, they will slowly whittle your team's HP down before you kill them.</li>
                        <li>Don't hoard your Technique Points. The items to restore them are around every corner, so always try to use a Technique to trigger the battle.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li class="list-border">
                    <b>Relics</b>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Don't upgrade every Relic piece you find. The materials needed to do that are pretty limited and once you use it up, you will need to farm Relics to feed into Relics to upgrade them.</li>
                        <li>Don't waste your stamina on farming Relics in the early game! Check the Stamina usage section below for more details about that.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li class="list-border">
                    <b>Warp</b>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Don't use Stellar Jades to pull on the General Warp. Only use the Basic Passes you gain from rewards and missions on that banner and save your Stellar Jades for the rate-up banners (or stamina refreshes).</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
